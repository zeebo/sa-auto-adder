SA Auto Adder

This makes a robot that will added users to all of the waves it is currently
participating in.

Users will be presented with a page where they can log in or create an account.
To create an account, they will be asked to put a token in their profile page
and their user id, and asked to give a new password for their account. If everything
works, they can then log in.

When they log in they will be presented with a control panel that lists all of the waves
the robot will allow them to join with options to join them.

To make the wave an sa wave, you just add the robot and then you are in control
of who the robot invites through the control panel. In other words there will be
a banlist for losers who cant wave right.
